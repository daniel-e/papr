migration to a more open and accessible storage structure for notes, summaries and metadata

- when starting check current storage
  if old storage -> migrate to new storage
- new storage
  old:
    <repo>/.paper/paper.db -> old database
  new:
    <repo>/xxx/p00000_.../{summary.md,notes.md}
      notes.md has a front matter for meta data
    <repo>/.paper/papers.yml (created at the end of the migration to detect interruptions of migration)
      -> list of papers with idx
      -> version of storage structure
